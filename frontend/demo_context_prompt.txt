## 🎮 Try the Demo

Experience the power of smart glasses technology firsthand! Our interactive demo allows you to test the core functionalities of the smart glasses system.

### What We've Completed

This demo showcases a fully functional smart glasses interface with the following implemented features:

- **Augmented Reality Overlays**: Real-time data visualization through AR glasses
- **Gesture Recognition**: Intuitive controls via hand gestures and eye tracking
- **Live Data Streaming**: Real-time synchronization of environmental data
- **AI-Powered Insights**: Machine learning models providing contextual information
- **Cross-Device Integration**: Seamless connectivity between glasses, mobile, and desktop

### Backend Integration

We've integrated a robust backend system that powers the demo:

- **Deployed Model Execution**: The backend runs pre-trained AI models optimized for edge computing
- **Real-time Processing**: Low-latency data processing for instant user feedback
- **API Endpoints**: RESTful APIs for model inference and data retrieval
- **Scalable Architecture**: Cloud-ready infrastructure supporting multiple concurrent users

Click the **"Try Demo"** button in the application to launch an interactive session where you can:
- Experience AR overlays in action
- Test gesture-based controls
- View live AI insights
- Interact with the deployed model through the backend

The demo connects to our backend services to run the deployed model, providing a realistic simulation of the smart glasses experience.
